# Laboratory of the Physics of Biological Systems (LPBS) - *C. elegans* Movement Analysis

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for analyzing movement patterns of *Caenorhabditis elegans* worms tracked on plates. The system can classify worms that have been administered drugs versus control worms and predict death proximity.

## Core Components

### Data Processing (`preprocessing.py`)

**Purpose**: Converts raw experimental data into analysis-ready format

**Key Features**:
- **Segment Creation**: Splits trajectories into segments (900 frames)
- **Data Cleaning**: Interpolates small gaps, removes large gaps
- **Normalization**: Coordinates to [0,1], angles to [-1,1]
- **Death Integration**: Uses lifespan data to exclude post-death segments
- **Quality Control**: Caps extreme speeds

**Output**: 
- `preprocessed_data/full/`: Complete worm trajectories
- `preprocessed_data/segments/`: Individual segments

### Feature Engineering (`feature_extraction.py`)

**Purpose**: Extracts 60+ biologically meaningful features from movement data

**Feature Categories**:

| Category | Features | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Basic Movement** | Mean/std/max speed, distance, pause time | Fundamental locomotion metrics |
| **Turning Behavior** | Turning angles, frequency, meandering ratios | Path complexity and exploration |
| **Physics-Inspired** | Kinetic energy proxy, movement efficiency | Energy and momentum concepts |
| **Statistical** | Skewness, kurtosis, entropy | Distribution characteristics |
| **Frequency Domain** | FFT-based dominant frequencies | Periodic movement patterns |
| **Wavelet Analysis** | Multi-scale decomposition | Time-frequency features |
| **Behavioral States** | Activity levels, roaming vs dwelling | High-level behavior classification |
| **Complexity** | Fractal dimensions, frenetic scores | Movement pattern complexity |

**Output**: 
- `feature_data/segments_features.csv`: Features for each segment
- `feature_data/full_features.csv`: Features for complete trajectories

### Data Loading (`data_loader.py`)

**Purpose**: Unified interface for accessing processed data with proper CV splitting

**Key Features**:
- **File-based splitting**: Prevents data leakage in cross-validation
- **Custom labeling**: Death proximity, original labels, time-based labels
- **Flexible filtering**: First N segments, specific time windows
- **Multiple formats**: Features, time series, metadata

**Usage Example**:
```python
from data_loader import LPBSDataLoader

loader = LPBSDataLoader()
X, y, groups = loader.load_segment_features_with_custom_labels(
    labeling_strategy="death_proximity",
    proximity_threshold=10
)
```

## Machine Learning Models

### 1. Feature-Based Models (`feature_segment_classification.py`)

**Algorithms**:
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method with feature importance
- **Gradient Boosting**: Sequential weak learner boosting  
- **Neural Network (MLP)**: Deep learning with regularization
- **K-Nearest Neighbors**: Instance-based learning

**Weighted Voting Strategies**:
- **Uniform**: Equal weight to all segments
- **Confidence**: Weight by prediction confidence
- **Late segments**: Higher weight to final segments
- **Last N segments**: Only consider final N segments

**Performance**: see comments at the end of the file

### 2. Time Series Models (`ts_segment_classification.py`)

**Deep Learning Architectures**:

#### 1D CNN
```python
Conv1D(128, kernel_size=3) → ReLU → 
Conv1D(256, kernel_size=3) → ReLU → 
GlobalAvgPool1D → Dense(2)
```

#### LSTM
```python
LSTM(128, num_layers=2) → Dense(2)
```

**Input Features**: 4D time series (x, y, speed, turning_angle)

### 3. Death Proximity Prediction (`death_proximity_predictor.py`)

**Purpose**: Predict when a worm is approaching death based on movement patterns

**Model Performance**:

## Analysis Tools

### Feature Importance Analysis (`feature_importance_analysis.py`)

**Methods**:
- **Random Forest Importance**: Built-in feature importance
- **Permutation Importance**: Model-agnostic feature ranking
- **Statistical Tests**: F-scores, mutual information
- **Combined Scoring**: Weighted ensemble of methods

**Output**: Ranked list of most discriminative features

### Aging Analysis (`first_vs_last_segment_analysis.py`)

**Purpose**: Identify features that change significantly with age

### Death Threshold Optimization (`compare_proximity_thresholds.py`)

**Purpose**: Compare performance of the predictive model depending on the definition of "close to death" (last X segments before death)
